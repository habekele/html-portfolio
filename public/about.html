<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Since the day I landed in the US, I was always fascinated with technology. I was playing with the radio and fan on the plane to my new home. Always been intrigued and curious about how such gadgets worked. I would take apart everything I could find from remotes to computers. I wanted to understand how all the little components worked together.

  Today not much has changed except that I am on the software side of things. I am always looking at the newest programs and software. I have the same drive to learn, understand, and create because there is always something new out there so I will always be engaged.

  Currently, I am a junior software developer. I am working on becoming a full-stack developer in the near future. Building web applications for myself and my friends in my spare time. I am passionate about what I do and hope to continue to grow and excel in my career.
